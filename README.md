# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we will be looking at Big Data and Cloud Services. Big Data is data that has more variety and is generating at high volumes quickly. Spark has become the leading technology for handling big data. This will allow us to process and analyze data quickly and at a massive scale. We will also be using Google Colab since it is hosted in the cloud. This makes it easier to read datasets that are from the cloud as well. Our data will be pulled from Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3).

### Purpose
The purpose of this week's project is help businesses optimize their marketing efforts at BigMarket. The project will be to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. Amazon Vine members are delivered products and are required to publish a review. We will be using PySpark to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. We will then be analyzing our data to determine if there is any bias toward favorable Vine member reviews. 

## Results
How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary
In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
